## Overview

Last time we introduced the topic of spacecraft GNC, and defined it as the study of "how we can know where our spacecraft is, how it's moving, and how we can control where it is and how it's moving" (I'm no poet). In this post we're going to carve off a piece of that topic, a piece called "attitude determination", and take a closer look. You won't find much code in this post. The goal here is to convey a basic understanding of the attitude determination problem as a set up to subsequent posts, in which we will consider more practical details like specific hardware and algorithms, and will ultimately code up some implementations. In other words, this is a primer. If you already know what attitude determination means, you may want to skip this post.

## What is Attitude?

"Attitude" in this context means spatial orientation, so when we talk about attitude determination for a spacecraft, it means "how can we determine the orientation of our spacecraft in space". It sounds pretty easy. If we're in LEO, can't we just... look at where the Sun is and know our orientation? Well, to be honest, at a very high level that's sort of how it works. But it's more complicated than that for a few reasons.

### Attitude is not a vector

First of all, attitude is not a vector. It contains more information than a single 3D vector, and so it requires more than one 3D observation to determine unambiguously. I will just tell you that attitude determination requires at least 2 such vectors. For an in-depth explanation of why this is the case, see [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19990052720/downloads/19990052720.pdf).

So, if attitude isn't a vector, what is it? It's a member of the 3D rotation group, commonly denoted [SO(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rotation_group). Basically, this "group" is a algebraic construct that precisely captures the mathematical features of attitude. For example, that if you rotate by 360 degrees about any axis, you wind up where you started. Unfortunately, SO(3) lacks a perfect, global parameterization, so we must choose from one of several *imperfect* ways to represent it, based on our needs.

### Attitude parameterization

There are several ways to represent attitude. I am going to restrict myself to just two of the most prevalent, but if you want to know more, you might start [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19990110711/downloads/19990110711.pdf). One important point before we get into specifics: whichever parameterization you use, your attitude value depends on your reference frame, which basically means your *origin and 3 axes*. That is, your attitude is independent of the reference frame, but the *numbers that you choose to represent your attitude* do depend on the reference frame. Relativity tells us that there is no absolute reference frame, so these can be defined however you want, but there are some commonly used frames that make solving certain problems easier. That's a hand-wavy explanation, see [here](https://spsweb.fltops.jpl.nasa.gov/portaldataops/mpg/MPG_Docs/MPG%20Book/Release/Chapter3-Coordinate%20&%20Reference%20Systems.pdf) for more detail.

#### Euler angles

I'll start with Euler angles, since these are the most widely known. If you're interested in terrestrial flight, you may be familiar with yaw, pitch, and roll. These are Euler angles (to be pedantic, these constitute one of 12 possible sets of Euler angles, but knowing that is not necessary to understand how they work).

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ad/euler-angles.jpg" width="100%" />

Euler angles represent attitude as 3 rotations about 3 different axes. Since the axes are given by your reference frame, the Euler angle attitude parameterization requires only 3 values: the 3 rotation angles. Attitude parameterizations can require as many as 9 (in the case of [DCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix), another common parameterization), so only needing 3 is attractive. Furthermore, Euler angles are relatively easy to understand and visualize. If I show you the axes and tell you to imagine the attitude (10, 20, 30) degrees, you can do it, after a little practice.

The downfall of Euler angles is ["gimbal lock"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock). This describes a situation in which two of the three rotational axes align, causing a the attitude to become undefined or ambiguous. A famous example of this is Apollo 11, in which an IMU on the command module came close to gimbal lock, requiring manual intervention by pilot Michael Collins (incidentally, the photographer behind [my all-time favorite photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/dno3mk/this_photo_has_every_human_alive_except_for/)). This is fine for planes, since they tend to point along the direction of motion, and thus rarely come close to the +/- 90 degrees pitch required for gimbal lock. But, for spacecraft, whose attitude is independent of the direction of motion, it's a terminal problem. Euler angles are very rarely used in spaceflight algorithms.

#### Unit quaternions (Euler parameters)

Quaternions are an esoteric bit of math. To a rough approximation, you can think of a quaternion as a complex number with one real and *three* imaginary elements. So, four parameters in total. We have 3 unknowns (the 3 rotation angles) and 4 parameters, so we need 4 - 3 = 1 constraint. Specifically, we constrain ourselves to quaternions of length 1, or unit quaternions (also called Euler parameters in this context). If you want to understand a bit about quaternions and the math that can be done with them, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ). For the purposes of this primer, though, its sufficient to know that unit quaternion math just works really well for 3D rotations. For example: if you have two quaternions ```q1``` and ```q2``` that represent two different attitudes, adding them up gives a quaternion ```q3``` that represents a third rotation, whose angles are the sums of the corresponding angles from the initial two attitudes. In other words, unit quaternion addition works just like attitude addition.

Quaternions are not terribly intuitive, nor are they easy to visualize. Their strength comes from the fact that they do not suffer from gimbal lock. If you use quaternions in your attitude determination system you don't have to worry about any such singularities. Furthermore, quaternions give rise to linear equations of motion, which is very helpful when you set out to do attitude control and you want to make sure that your control system is stable. In summary: quaternions are not intuitive, but they are a convenient attitude parameterization. They are quite common in practice.

## Determining Attitude

We have established that at least two observation vectors are required to determine our attitude, and now we are going to talk about how to do it. I'm going to start with a lightning round history of approaches to static attitude determination, which isn't used much nowadays, and then move onto popular sequential methods.

#### A quick note about terminology

When talking about attitude, the words "determination" and "estimation" mean the same thing. There is a fairly weak convention that attitude *determination* refers to the one-and-done process of figuring out the attitude, while attitude *estimation* refers more to the continual process of always knowing the current attitude, but that is not a hard-and-fast rule. In general, I think it makes sense to consider these terms as interchangeable.

### Static Attitude Determination

Static attitude determination is the process of estimating the current attitude from a single, current set of observation vectors.

#### Wahba's problem

The static attitude determination problem was famously framed by statistician Grace Wahba as an optimization problem with cost function

$$
J(\mathbf{R}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \| \mathbf{R} \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{s}_i \|^2
$$

where $\mathbf{R}$ is the attitude estimate (parameterized here as a [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix)), the $\mathbf{s}_i$'s are the observation vectors, the $\mathbf{r}_i$'s are the corresponding reference vectors, and $a$ contains a weight for each vector pair. In English, Wahba's problem can be written "find the optimal attitude estimate, in a least squares sense, given a set of N observation vectors".

#### The TRIAD method

The earliest method for determining attitude from (two) observation vectors actually predates Wahba's problem. It's described well on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_method), so I'm not going to describe it in detail. The basic idea is that you use two observation vectors to define a new reference frame, then calculate the transformations between that frame and both the starting reference frame and the reference frame defined by the spacecraft attitude, and then you apply those transformations to yield the attitude. This is a perfectly valid approach, and it's lighting fast to calculate, but it does not give the optimal solution according to Wahba's cost function.

#### Davenport's q-method

Davenport's q-method is a quaternion (hence the "q") solution to Wahba's problem - that is, it gives an optimal attitude solution in a least squares sense. [See here](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2275087) for a good walkthrough of the math. While this method is optimal, it's slow, due to the fact that it involves solving a 4D eigensystem, which has time complexity O( n^3 ). This leads us to...

#### QUEST

QUEST, short for QUaternion ESTimator, is based on Davenport's q-method. The key difference is that, instead of solving the aforementioned 4D eigensystem analytically, it uses Newton-Raphson iteration to approximate it. This has the advantage of speeding things up considerably, and while it's only an approximation of the optimal solution, in practice the iteration tends to converge very quickly, yielding a nearly exact solution in little time.

Those are the cliff notes on static attitude determination. Now we move onto the more practical topic of sequential methods.

### Sequential Attitude Estimation

Unlike static methods, which are, well, static, sequential methods attempt to maintain a running estimate of the current attitude as new observations come in. While static methods may be applicable to spacecraft in certain niche cases, sequential attitude estimation is required for virtually every spacecraft. Whether you're designing a Earth satellite, a lunar lander, or a deep space probe, it almost certainly needs to know its attitude. And, since getting things to space is expensive, the craft will need to be occupied productively pretty much constantly, which means it will constantly need its attitude. So, sequential attitude estimation is crucial.

The methods covered below are variants of the Kalman Filter. I have written about this topic before, so rather than go into detail here, I will provide links to the relevant posts. [Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/05/31/kf.html) is a link to the first post, which introduces the linear Kalman Filter. If this is new to you, I recommend starting there, even though it doesn't work very well for attitude estimation because attitude is inherently nonlinear (remember, we're in SO(3)).

Now let's cover a couple of variants that *do* work well for attitude estimation.

#### The Extended Kalman Filter

**The EKF is the bread and butter of sequential attitude estimation.** The idea is simple: you take your nonlinear system, linearize it, and then use a linear Kalman Filter (it's slightly more complicated than that makes it sound, but that's the idea). [Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/06/07/ekf.html) is a link to my post on the EKF.

The EKF has been around since the early days of space exploration (Apollo). It works because attitude tends to change very slowly, and so as long as our attitude estimator runs quickly relative to our attitude rates, the linear approximation works very well.

#### The Unscented Kalman Filter

The UKF is a relative newcomer to sequential attitude estimation. Here the idea is a little more subtle. Instead of linearizing your system, you choose a few samples from your Gaussian estimate, called sigma points, pass them through your nonlinear system, yielding a non-Gaussian distribution, and then Gaussian-ize that output. [Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/06/28/ukf.html) is a link to my post on the UKF.

I am not sure to what extent the UKF has been used on actual spacecraft. The EKF tends to work very well, so there isn't usually much need for an alternative. In general, the UKF is likely to perform better when the target system is highly nonlinear, such that the linearization of EKF is inaccurate enough to cause instability. So, one situation in which it might be advantageous to use a UKF is for very high angular rates, when the attitude might change significantly between measurements. However, for most missions, the EKF is easy and will work.

## Attitude Determination and Control

We usually don't talk about attitude determination on its own. More often we talk about *Attitude Determination and Control* (ADC) or an *Attitude Determination and Control System* (ADCS), in which we not only estimate our attitude but also attempt to control it over time. Attitude control is a topic for a separate, future set of posts, but before ending this post I want to show where attitude determination fits into this overall system.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ad/adc.drawio.png" width="100%" />

Basically, our attitude *controller* needs to know what are attitude is *now* and what we want our attitude to be in the *future*, and out attitude determination system provides the former.

## Conclusion

This post was a quick introduction to the attitude determination/estimation problem. We started by describing "attitude": what it is, why it's important, and how we can represent it. We then did a walkthrough of the most prominent methods for estimating attitude, starting with the static methods, and then shifting to the more useful, sequential methods. Finally, we put attitude determination into the context of a complete ADCS. In subsequent posts we will make use of this knowledge. I plan to delve into the practical details (hardware, algorithms) of how actual, modern spacecraft perform attitude determination.
