# Overview

In the [previous post](https://alexmcmaster.github.io/blog/2024/09/20/ads.html) we finally built and tested an attitude determination system in simulation. However, as noted at the end of the post, our simulation environment remains a fairly simplistic approximation of the true Earth orbit environment. In this post we will discuss prominent sources of disturbance forces and torques (aka orbital perturbations) and how we can model them to make our simulation more realistic and useful.

# Disturbances

First off: what is a disturbance force/torque? Well, a disturbance *force* is any force besides (1) the gravitational force applied by the body about which we're orbiting or (2) a force that we create intentionally, such as that imparted by a thruster firing. A disturbance *torque* is any torque besides those that we create intentionally with reaction wheels or the like. Since we have so far focused on *attitude* determination, we are going to focus more on disturbance *torques*, but we will mention forces in a couple of places.

Disturbances tend to be much smaller in magnitude than their non-disturbance counterparts, but that does not necessarily make them negligible. The significance of disturbances is generally context-dependent, and can be quite complex to determine precisely. For example, atmospheric drag is all but nonexistent in very high orbits like GEO because, well, there's no atmosphere, but it can be very significant in lower regions. Moreover, the relationship between altitude and drag depends on the solar cycle, and even on atmospheric temperature (more on this later). So, take heed: estimating disturbance effects with any precision can be quite challenging. But not impossible! Let's take a closer look at some of the most significant sources of disturbance forces/torques in Earth orbit.

## 1) The J2 Effect

The J2 Effect, also called J2 perturbation, is the disturbance force resulting from the fact that Earth is a rough *oblate spheroid* rather than a perfect sphere. This means that the magnitude and direction of the gravitational force vary not only with our distance from the center of the Earth, but *where we are* above the Earth.

We can deal with this by adopting a gravity model that accounts for this variation: we tell it our position vector relative to the center of the Earth, and it tells us what the gravity is. In fact, we're already doing this with this line:

```python
grav_bodies["earth"].useSphericalHarmonicsGravityModel(bskPath + "/supportData/LocalGravData/GGM03S.txt", 10)
```

This says "for Earth, use the gravity model stored at GGM03S.txt with up to 10th order spherical harmonics". Spherical harmonics are a way of breaking down the surface of a sphere like so:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dtb/harmonics.png" width="100%" />
*Image source: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Real-part-of-a-set-of-spherical-harmonics-mapped-to-the-surface-of-a-sphere-The-colour_fig1_345372557*

Now there's an important distinction to be made. The term "J2" refers specifically to the 2nd order harmonic - that is, the one that accounts for Earth's oblateness. However, colloquially, "J2 perturbation" is often used to refer to the total effect of all of the harmonics. That is, the entire perturbation due to Earth's imperfect shape.

### J2 in Basilisk

We're already using a gravity model with 10th order harmonics, so our simulation accounts for this. I want to keep this high-level, so that's all the detail we'll go into for now. If you want to dive deeper into the math and theory there are plenty of orbital mechanics lecture series out there. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd99oeN9F98)'s a good one.

## 2) Solar Radiation Pressure

In case you didn't know, the Sun is a great big fireball powered by nuclear fusion. Fun fact: by measuring the Sun's energy output and applying E=mc^2 we find that the Sun converts about 4 million tons of matter into energy *every second*. Anyway... this **solar** process generates a lot of photons that **radiate** outwards into the solar system. While these photons have no mass, [Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations) tells us that they do have momentum, which can be imparted to bodies such as spacecraft, which, at the macro scale, results in a **pressure** force directed away from the Sun. So there you have it, Solar Radiation Pressure, or SRP for short.

In general, the perturbation due to SRP is a force directed outward from the sun with magnitude proportional to the inverse square of the distance. However, there are a couple of important caveats:

1. The momentum transferred by each photon depends on the reflectivity of the impacted surface. If the surface is absorptive, photons tend to get absorbed and a smaller amount of momentum is transferred. If the surface is reflective, photons tend to get, well, reflected, with a larger momentum transfer. This is analogous to the physics of inelastic and elastic collisions. The result is that the reflectivity of our spacecraft is important and needs to be modeled. Note also that if parts of our spacecraft are more reflective than others, different forces will be applied at different points, leading to disturbance *torques*. So, SRP isn't as simple as it looks.
2. SRP can be blocked or diverted. If a large body, say the Earth or the Moon, is between our spacecraft and the Sun, it will experience little to no SRP.

### SRP in Basilisk

Basilisk offers a couple of options for modeling SRP. One is the ```RadiationPressure``` module, which can model SRP using either the Cannonball Method or the Table Look-up Method. In the cannonball method, the spacecraft is assumed to be a sphere with uniform optical reflectivity properties, such that SRP imparts a constant force directed away from the Sun, scaled by the distance from the Sun. This method can be quite inaccurate, since a typical spacecraft will have various faces (or facets) with different reflectivity properties. In the table look-up method, the user is responsible for specifying the expected SRP force and torque over a range of Sun-relative attitudes, and Basilisk will choose the closest available one of these at each time step during simulation. This method can be accurate if the attitude space is sampled densely (that is, if we provide torque and force values for a significant number of possible attitudes), however, this places a burden on the user to go out and calculate all of these values.

Fortunately, Basilisk offers the ```FacetSRPDynamicEffector``` module, which offers both accuracy and (relative) convenience. This is the module we will use for our simulation. First, some boilerplate: we instantiate the module, name it, and tell it that our spacecraft is a box with no articulated (dynamic) facets.

```python
SRPEffector = facetSRPDynamicEffector.FacetSRPDynamicEffector()
SRPEffector.ModelTag = "SRPEffector"
SRPEffector.numFacets = 6
SRPEffector.numArticulatedFacets = 0
````

Next, we give the orientation of each facet by specifying its normal vector in the body frame. As stated above, our spacecraft is a box.

```python
facetNormals_B = [ 
    np.array(( 1.0,  0.0,  0.0)),
    np.array((-1.0,  0.0,  0.0)),
    np.array(( 0.0,  1.0,  0.0)),
    np.array(( 0.0, -1.0,  0.0)),
    np.array(( 0.0,  0.0,  1.0)),
    np.array(( 0.0,  0.0, -1.0)),
]
```

Next, we give the center of pressure for each facet. This setting is crucial for determining the torque imparted by SRP.

```python
locationsPntB_B = [ 
    np.array(( 0.5,  0.0,  0.0)),
    np.array((-0.5,  0.0,  0.0)),
    np.array(( 0.0,  0.5,  0.0)),
    np.array(( 0.0, -0.5,  0.0)),
    np.array(( 0.0,  0.0,  0.5)),
    np.array(( 0.0,  0.0, -0.5)),
]
```

Next, we give the rotational axes of any facets that are articulating (in our case this is none of them).

```python
rotAxes_B = [ 
    np.array((0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
    np.array((0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
    np.array((0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
    np.array((0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
    np.array((0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
    np.array((0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
]
```

Next the area of each facet. We'll make our spacecraft a 1 meter cube.

```python
facetAreas = np.array((1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))
```

Next, the reflection coefficients. Specular reflection refers to reflection that is directed. A surface with a high spectral reflection coefficient, such as a mirror or polished metal, will look shiny. Diffuse reflection refers to reflection that is scattered. A surface with a high diffuse reflection coefficient will look bright (to the degree that there is incident light), but not shiny. For example: a surface painted matte white. Some useful graphics [here](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refln/lesson-1/specular-vs-diffuse-reflection). Note that in at least one place Basilisk refers to the *spectral* coefficients. This is a typo: it's supposed to be *specular*.

```python
specularCoeffs = np.array((0.9, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
diffuseCoeffs = np.array((0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
```

And now for the final boilerplate. We add the facets to the model, let the model know where the Sun is at all times, connect the model to our spacecraft, and add the model to our simulation.

```python
for i in range(SRPEffector.numFacets):
    SRPEffector.addFacet(facetAreas[i], specularCoeffs[i], diffuseCoeffs[i],
                         facetNormals_B[i], locationsPntB_B[i], rotAxes_B[i])
SRPEffector.sunInMsg.subscribeTo(planetStateOutMsgs["sun"])
scObject.addDynamicEffector(SRPEffector)
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, SRPEffector)
```

Done. Now let's rerun our simulation and see how much of a difference this makes. Here's the difference in (quaternion) attitude and angular rates introduced by the inclusion of SRP.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dtb/srp-gt-diff.png" width="100%" />

Not too significant. We can expect the disparity to grow as time goes on. For example, here's what happens if we run our simulation for 2.5 times as long.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dtb/srp-gt-diff-long.png" width="100%" />

The attitude disparity in particular gets bigger. You might ask: "we don't account for SRP in our process model... will this growing disparity cause our filter to diverge"? Fortunately, the answer is *probably not*. Remember, each update of our EKF involves both a prediction *and* a correction step. While SRP will introduce a (tiny) error into the prediction step, this error will be addressed in the correction step, when new sensor readings are taken that are unaffected by the SRP. This goes for other disturbances as well. Significant, acute disturbances can introduce large estimate errors that take many time steps to go away (or can even cause filter divergence if they are significant enough to break the linearization step), but minor disturbances are easily corrected for using measurements.

It would be useful here to verify, at least with some back-of-napkin math, that the effect we see in simulation is correct, as well as to discuss some of the ways in which Basilisk's facet SRP model is still just an approximation. But, this section is already too long. We'll save this for a future post.

## 3) Drag

There has been much disagreement over the years about exactly how high you have to be to be "in space". The conventional, modern answer is that you must be above the "Kármán line", named after prolific aerospace engineer and polymath Theodore von Kármán. While the official definition of this line is 100 km above sea level, Kármán saw his line as a fuzzy boundary above which airplane flight becomes impossible. Kármán is an interesting figure, but I'll resist the temptation to go into more detail here. The point is that there's no sharp line at which the atmosphere disappears and we shift from aeronautics to astronautics. In fact, up to several hundreds of km, including most of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), atmospheric drag can have a meaningful impact on dynamics, due in part to the fact that orbital speed at these altitudes is on the order of 28,000 kph.

Let's quickly review how the drag force works. Drag, also known as fluid resistance, is a force experienced by an object moving through a fluid or gas, in the direction opposite its motion. As indicated by the latter name, calculating the drag force is, fundamentally, a problem of fluid dynamics, which means that the math is generally tractable but vastly complex. Fortunately, a good low-order approximation exists, which embeds this complexity into a scalar known as the *drag coefficient*. Here is the resulting equation for the drag force:

$$
F_D = \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2 C_D A
$$

$F_D$: the drag force

$\rho$: the density of the surrounding fluid

$v$: the speed of the object relative to the surrounding fluid

$C_D$: the drag coefficient

$A$: the cross-sectional area of the object

Two things to point out here. (1) While $F_D$ is proportional to $\rho$ and $\rho$ is extremely small in any typical spacecraft orbit, $F_D$ is also proportional to the *square* of object speed, which is extremely high in lower spacecraft orbits. This helps explain why drag can be meaningful even when there is almost no atmosphere to speak of. (2) The drag coefficient $C_D$, which you can read more about [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient), accounts, roughly speaking, for how aerodynamic the object is. Spacecraft tend to be very boxy, and therefore tend to have poor aerodynamics.

### Drag in Basilisk

Basilisk provides FacetDragDynamicEffector module that works much like the FacetSRPDynamicEffector module seen previously. Conveniently, we can reuse the facet definitions from that module. All we need to add is an atmosphere and some boilerplate.

As usual, Basilisk gives us a couple of options for defining an atmosphere. After combing through several examples, it looks like the best supported of these is the ExponentialAtmosphere model, which models atmospheric density as an exponential decay function of altitude. Specifically...

$$
\rho = \rho_{0} e^{\frac{-h}{h_{0}}}
$$

Where $\rho$ is the atmospheric density at altitude $h$, $\rho_{0}$ is the density at surface level, and $h_{0}$ is a constant specific to the body known as the *atmospheric scale height*. Values for this constant are available [from NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetfact.html). Here is how it's done in Basilisk, with constants drawn from the aforementioned link.

```python
atmosphere = exponentialAtmosphere.ExponentialAtmosphere()
atmosphere.ModelTag = "atmosphere"
atmosphere.planetRadius = orbitalMotion.REQ_EARTH * 1e3  # m
atmosphere.scaleHeight =  8.5                     * 1e3  # m
atmosphere.baseDensity =  1.217                   * 1e0  # kg/m^3
atmosphere.addSpacecraftToModel(scObject.scStateOutMsg)
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, atmosphere)
```

We also need to specify the drag coefficient for each facet. According to [this paper](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20110016614/downloads/20110016614.pdf) from NASA, the drag coefficient for a cube is a function of Mach number, but is predicted to converge to ~1.7 above Mach 4 or so. We'll use that number for now.

```python
dragCoeffs = np.array((1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7))
```

Then, of course, we need to add and configure our drag model.

```python
dragEffector = facetDragDynamicEffector.FacetDragDynamicEffector()
dragEffector.ModelTag = "dragEffector"
for i in range(len(facetAreas)):
    dragEffector.addFacet(facetAreas[i], dragCoeffs[i],
                          facetNormals_B[i], locationsPntB_B[i])
dragEffector.atmoDensInMsg.subscribeTo(atmosphere.envOutMsgs[-1])
scObject.addDynamicEffector(dragEffector)
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, dragEffector)
```

Now we can run our simulation and see what sort of effect drag has.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dtb/drag-gt-diff.png" width="100%" />

...nothing. Why? Because our simulation's initial conditions specify an altitude of 700 km, which is too high for atmospheric drag to have a meaningful effect.

```python
ALT_KM = 700
```

Let's try dropping that initial altitude a bit.

```python
ALT_KM = 100
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dtb/drag-gt-diff-low.png" width="100%" />

There we go. The effect on attitude and angular rates is very small, but it's there. Of course, the effect is much more dramatic on our spacecraft's orbital parameters than on its attitude.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dtb/drag-low-plots.png" width="100%" />

Starting from 100 km and accounting for drag, our semi-major axis immediately begins to plummet. This is what reentry looks like.

## 4) Magnetic Field Interactions

I assume that if you're reading my blog you have, at some point in your life, experienced the joy of playing with magnets. What happens when you bring two magnets near each other? Each exerts a force on the other. Well, the Earth has a magnetic field, and any spacecraft that uses electricity (hint: all of them) will have a magnetic field, so magnetic forces and torques will be exerted by Earth on a spacecraft (and vise versa, but that effect is... beyond negligible). To a first-order approximation, a spacecraft's magnetic moment comes from two sources: (1) permanent magnetism in the spacecraft and (2) current loops generated by the spacecraft's electronics.

There are two steps to dealing with magnetic field interactions. First, we want to minimize our spacecraft's magnetic moment. This is done through the selection of appropriate materials and parts, as well as through the process of [*degaussing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degaussing) (also called *deperming* in the business), by which permanent magnetism is removed from an object. Second, we want to account for any residual magnetic moment that we can't get rid of, so that we know our ADCS can handle it.

### Magnetic field interactions in Basilisk

Unfortunately Basilisk doesn't have any models for this. It should be possible to jury rig something with the MtbEffector ([magnetic torque bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorquer)) module, but this post is already pretty long, so I may save this for a future post dedicated to general topic of dealing with magnetic fields.

# Conclusion

In this post we looked at various sources of disturbance forces and torques, how they can perturb our spacecraft's state vector, and how they can be accounted for in simulation. We started with the J2 effect, which describes the effect of the non-spherical Earth. We then covered Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP), or the effect of particles radiating outward from the Sun. Next we talked about atmospheric drag, which, perhaps surprisingly, can have an appreciable effect on spacecraft as high as several hundred kilometers above sea-level. Finally, we discussed magnetic field interactions, how they can be mitigated, and how the residual effects can be accounted for. While all of the models used in this post are still just approximations, each one serves to improve the fidelity of our simulation - that is, to make it a *better approximation of reality*. No simulation is perfect, but the closer it is to reality, the more useful it is to us, and the more confidence it provides that our design will lead to a successful mission.
