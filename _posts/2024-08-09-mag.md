# Overview

[Last time]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/07/26/css.html) we looked at the Coarse Sun Sensor (CSS) and made it the first attitude determination sensor to go into our Basilisk simulation. This week we're covering a new sensor: the magnetometer. As before, we will use the datasheet of a real magnetometer to gain a deeper understanding of this type of device, and we will then add it to our Basilisk simulation.

# The Magnetometer

A magnetometer measures the local magnetic field - it's that simple. In space applications, the most common type is the "digital" magnetometer, which means that what is returned is a digital measurement: typically of the X, Y, and Z components of the magnetic field in the sensor's reference frame (we will cover this "sensor frame" later on). So, while the CSS gives us our orientation relative to the Sun, the magnetometer gives us our orientation relative to Earth's magnetic field (technically the local magnetic field, but in LEO the Earth's magnetic field will dominate).

## The Magnetic Field Model

Remember from the post on [attitude determination]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/07/19/ad.html) that it's all about comparing observation vectors against reference vectors. In the case of the magnetometer, the observation vector is given directly by the device, and the reference vector is what we expect the local magnetic field to be. Comparing these gives us our estimated orientation with respect to Earth's magnetic field. First, though, we have to know what we should expect the local magnetic field to be. That's done with a magnetic field model, which is a model that takes our position as an input, and returns a magnetic field vector as an output. More on this once we get to Basilisk.

## Magnetometer characteristics

[Here's a datasheet](https://aerospace.honeywell.com/content/dam/aerobt/en/documents/learn/products/sensors/datasheet/SmartDigitalMagnetometerHMR2300_ds.pdf) for a magnetometer suitable for use on a spacecraft. It's a bit longer than the CSS one from that post, which makes sense, because it's a more complex device.

### The importance of calibration

Before we start picking apart this datasheet, I want to quickly highlight the importance of calibration. Throughout the "specifications" table in the datasheet we see the footnote (2), which, if we scroll to the bottom, signifies "tested at 25 degrees C except stated otherwise". That's all well and good, but the operating range of this device is, as it is for most space electronics, -40 to +85 degrees C. That's a big range, and it would be unwise to assume that what's true at 25C will be true across that whole range. Furthermore, we may very well see this entire temperature range on orbit. The Sun will bake our spacecraft when it's in full sunlight, and we'll have trouble getting rid of all of that heat when there's no atmosphere to carry it away. Then, when we're in eclipse, we'll be in the cold vacuum of space. More information on temperature [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20060013394/downloads/20060013394.pdf).

Anyway, the point is that this datasheet doesn't necessarily tell us all we need to know. If one of those fields marked with a (2) is an input to our magnetometer sensor model, then we'll need to determine its value across the entire range of temperatures that we might expect to see. Fortunately, this can be done on the ground as part of the calibration or characterization process. In the case of temperature, we might do this by placing the device in a [thermal vacuum (TVAC) chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_vacuum_chamber) and measuring the value ourselves across a wide range of temperatures. And temperature is only an example. In fact, even for values that are explicitly given in the datasheet, with no footnotes or other qualifications, it's wise to confirm them in-house if they're important. Engineers make mistakes, and one wrong value has the potential to doom an otherwise functional spacecraft.

Anyway, back to the datasheet.

### Range

This is given as +/- 2 gauss, which is equivalent to +/- 200k nT (nanotesla). Earth's magnetic field tops out around 65k nT, so we have plenty of margin.

### Resolution

This is 67 micro-gauss, or 6.7 nT. That means that fluctuations in the local magnetic field less than 6.7 nT will be lost to quantization error. Fortunately, this is roughly 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the values we expect to measure, so such errors should be quite minor.

### Accuracy

The authors have conveniently summed all error sources into a single metric, with a typical value of 0.12% and a worst case value of 0.52% at 25 degrees C within the range of +/- 80k nT. Either way it's significantly smaller than 1%. However, there's a factor of 5 difference between the "typical" value and the worst case value, which is pretty significant. This is definitely something that we would want to test in characterization/calibration.

### Sensor frame

Conspicuously absent - but probably available in another document. This is a key piece of information, because when the device says that the local magnetic field is [40k, 10k, 11k] nT in the X, Y, and Z directions, we need to know what those directions are.

# Adding a Magnetometer in Basilisk

Now it's time to add a magnetometer to our simulation.

## Where to put it?

When mounting an actual magnetometer on an actual spacecraft, location is important. Magnetometers are, of course, sensitive to electromagnetic noise, and spacecraft are replete with sources of such noise: avionics, radios, scientific experiments, etc. Broadly speaking there two ways to handle this. First, you can affix the magnetometer on the end of a long boom, which keeps it as far away from the aforementioned noise sources as possible. Second, you can develop a model of these noise sources and use that model to correct for them. Ok, I lied, there's a third way to go: you can just ignore this issue and accept that the noise is going to adversely affect your ADCS. This third way is very [NewSpace](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2023-11/newspace_nasa.pdf).

Now, while this may be an important issue in the real world, it's not an issue in Basilisk because our spacecraft doesn't produce any EM noise. So we're going to be NewSpace and ignore this for now. But take heed.

## The Magnetometer interface in Basilisk

You can find the documentation [here](https://hanspeterschaub.info/basilisk/Documentation/simulation/sensors/magnetometer/magnetometer.html).

See [here](https://github.com/alexmcmaster/basilisk/blob/develop/sims/sim2-MAG.py) for the full simulation in my Basilisk fork.

## Adding it to the simulation

### The magnetic field model

Basilisk provides very convenient access to the [World Magnetic Model (WMM)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-magnetic-model), which was created and is maintained by agencies in the US and UK governments, and is updated every 5 years.

```python
magModule = magneticFieldWMM.MagneticFieldWMM()
magModule.ModelTag = "WMM"
magModule.dataPath = bskPath + "/supportData/MagneticField/"
magModule.planetPosInMsg.subscribeTo(planetStateOutMsgs["earth"])
epochMsg = unitTestSupport.timeStringToGregorianUTCMsg(
    START_TIME.strftime("%Y %b %d, %X (UTC)"))
magModule.epochInMsg.subscribeTo(epochMsg)
magModule.addSpacecraftToModel(scObject.scStateOutMsg)
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, magModule)
```

The WMM module needs to know where to find its associated data, the position/orientation of the Earth and spacecraft at all times, and when we want to start.

### The three-axis magnetometer (TAM)

```python
TAM = magnetometer.Magnetometer()
TAM.ModelTag = "TAM_sensor"
TAM.scaleFactor = 1.0
TAM.senNoiseStd = [100e-9, 100e-9, 100e-9]
TAM.stateInMsg.subscribeTo(scObject.scStateOutMsg)
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, TAM)
```

This should be pretty straightforward. We add 100 nT of AWGN on each magnetometer axis to (approximately) capture the 96 nT reported as "typical" by the datasheet. Let's say that we've tested it ourselves and have found 100 to be more accurate.

## Results

*Simulation results, magnetometer outputs in the bottom right.*

Much as with the CSS outputs, we can see the magnetometer outputs vary sinusoidally as the spacecraft rotates. But there are a couple of key differences. First, the magnetometer outputs do not hold at zero, because the magnetometer is not constrained by a limited field of view: a single magnetometer can sense the local magnetic field regardless of spacecraft attitude. Second, the magnetometer outputs will *typically* be out of phase with the sun sensor outputs, because they are measuring different things: the direction (and magnitude) of the local magnetic field and the direction (and distance) of the Sun, respectively. I say *typically*, because if the local magnetic field is aligned with the Sun vector, then the measurements will be in phase, and we will have observability problems. More about that in the next post.

# Conclusion

Today we discussed the magnetometer, an ADCS sensor that aids the attitude determination process by providing measurements of the local magnetic field for comparison with a magnetic field model. After a brief tangent on calibration, we peeked at the datasheet of a real space-capable magnetometer and analyzed some of its attributes. We then added a three-axis magnetometer (TAM) to our Basilisk simulation along with a magnetic field model to enable the use of our TAM in attitude determination. The next post in this series will be big: we're going to make use of our sensors by finally doing some attitude determination on orbit.
