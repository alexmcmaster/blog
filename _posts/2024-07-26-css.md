## Overview

Last week we introduced the topic of attitude determination and talked at a high level about some of the algorithms that can be used to achieve it. In this post we're getting practical. We're going to take a look at the Coarse Sun Sensor (CSS), which is perhaps the most humble of sensors used in attitude determination systems, and towards the end we will add it to our Basilisk simulation.

## The Coarse Sun Sensor

The CSS is a very simple sensor: all it does is turn light into electrical current. More light, more current. The basic idea is, you put a few of these on your spacecraft (typically 6 if it's box-shaped, one on each face), and you can tell where the sun is, roughly, by looking at how much current each one produces. This gives you your estimated Sun vector, which can be used as one of the two observation vectors (remember that we need at least 2, as discussed in the [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/07/19/ad.html) required for an attitude solution.

### CSS characteristics

Let's look at a datasheet to see what an actual CSS is like. [Here's one.](https://redwirespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/redwire-coarse-sun-sensor-cosine-type-flyheet.pdf) The "parameters" section has move of the information that we need.

#### Field of view

If you had to distill a CSS down to a single number, this would probably be it. Field of view (FOV) refers to the maximum angle that the CSS can be pointed away from the Sun vector and still produce some output current. Once the FOV is exceeded, the CSS can't tell us anything, except that the Sun isn't in the FOV. This is why we almost always use multiple CSS's - because no single one can cover the entire field around the spacecraft.

While some CSS datasheets will give an angle for FOV, this one reports "approximate cosine, conical symmetry". This can roughly be translated to almost 90 degrees (approximate cosine) regardless of how you spin the CSS on its sensing axis (conical symmetry). To get a more detailed answer, we can look at the figure on the next page titled "Typical CSS response with no baffles installed". This shows that the CSS stops producing current around 85 degrees, provided no baffles are installed. Keep in mind that as the output current gets smaller, precision will tend to degrade due to things like numerical precision and component tolerances, so the useful FOV may be a little bit narrower. Figuring this out for particular devices is part of the calibration process.

Looking at the aforementioned figure, you may wonder why the response isn't a perfect cosine, since, to a first order approximation, this is what we should expect. Cosine gives the ratio of the incident power w.r.t. viewing angle vs the peak power. The reason for this deviation is that no sensor is perfect. If you zoom way in on the light-collecting surface of the sensor you won't see a perfectly flat surface, which collects light according to the cosine of the angle of incidence, you'll see a rough surface with big features on it. All of this complexity is approximated with a single number, called the "Kelly factor" or "Kelly parameter" $\kappa$.

The normalized output current is then given by

$$
\gamma = \widehat{\gamma} * (1 - \exp{-\widehat{\gamma}^{2} / \kappa})
$$

where $\widehat{\gamma}$ is the naive current estimate and $\gamma$ is the current corrected for Kelly imperfection.

#### Input power

None. This is a nice feature of the CSS: it's essentially a little solar cell that converts photons into electrons, so it generally doesn't need to be actively powered. This makes is especially useful for contingency modes where some fault has been detected and all we want to do is point our solar panels at the Sun so that our batteries don't die.

#### Peak output

This is given as 500-1300 microamps (this of course will depend on how far your spacecraft is from the Sun, as solar irradiance varies as the inverse square of distance). It's not a very big signal, and we'll want it as volts so that we can digitize it with an ADC and use it in our flight software. This part is a little outside my expertise, so take this with a grain of salt, but I expect this is usually done with some sort of an Op-Amp circuit.

### Other assorted info

#### Mass

Here's another nice feature of the CSS: it weighs nothing. This particular device, which appears to be a very high-quality CSS, weights just 10 grams. Even with 6 of them, that's less than a seventh of a pound.

#### Baffles

The Sun isn't the only source of light in the solar system. There's reflections off of the moon, off of the Earth, and off of the spacecraft itself. If we don't need the full ~90 degrees of FOV, which we typically don't, we can add baffles (sort of like blinders for a horse) to artificially limit our FOV and block out some of those sources of unwanted light.

#### Heritage

The device has impressive mission heritage, including a few ~billion dollar missions, a couple of Mars missions, and "classified programs", likely referring to the [NRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office), which can be assumed to be at the bleeding edge of satellite technology. All of this means that this particular device can be trusted, and that it's probably quite expensive relative to other CSS hardware.

## Adding 6x CSS to Basilisk

Now it's time to write some code. We want to have 6 CSS's on our spacecraft, one on each face, to maximize our total field of view. We're not going to do anything with these yet (actual attitude determination and control will come later), but we'll record their outputs so we can confirm that they work.

### The CSS interface in Basilisk

You can find the documentation [here](https://hanspeterschaub.info/basilisk/Documentation/simulation/sensors/coarseSunSensor/coarseSunSensor.html).

See [here](https://github.com/alexmcmaster/basilisk/blob/9cbc0edc18d2c2884697fbb367e6520d32a9438b/sims/sim1-CSS.py) for the full simulation in my Basilisk fork.

### Adding it to the simulation

```python
    # Define CSS units. Parameters common to all are hardcoded, while parameters
    # that differ between units are given as parameters.
    def setupCSS(CSS, tag, pos, direction):
        CSS.fov = 90. * macros.D2R
        CSS.scaleFactor = 1.0
        CSS.maxOutput = 1.0
        CSS.minOutput = 0
        CSS.kellyFactor = 0.1
        CSS.senBias = 0.0  # normalized sensor bias
        CSS.senNoiseStd = 0.01  # normalized sensor noise
        CSS.sunInMsg.subscribeTo(planetStateOutMsgs["sun"])
        CSS.stateInMsg.subscribeTo(scObject.scStateOutMsg)
        CSS.sunEclipseInMsg.subscribeTo(eclipseObject.eclipseOutMsgs[0])
        CSS.ModelTag = tag
        CSS.r_B = np.array(pos)
        CSS.nHat_B = np.array(direction)

    CSS0 = coarseSunSensor.CoarseSunSensor()
    setupCSS(CSS0, "CSS0_sensor", [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0])
    CSS1 = coarseSunSensor.CoarseSunSensor()
    setupCSS(CSS1, "CSS1_sensor", [-1, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 0])
    CSS2 = coarseSunSensor.CoarseSunSensor()
    setupCSS(CSS2, "CSS2_sensor", [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0])
    CSS3 = coarseSunSensor.CoarseSunSensor()
    setupCSS(CSS3, "CSS3_sensor", [0, -1, 0], [0, -1, 0])
    CSS4 = coarseSunSensor.CoarseSunSensor()
    setupCSS(CSS4, "CSS4_sensor", [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1])
    CSS5 = coarseSunSensor.CoarseSunSensor()
    setupCSS(CSS5, "CSS5_sensor", [0, 0, -1], [0, 0, -1])
    cssList = [CSS0, CSS1, CSS2, CSS3, CSS4, CSS5]
```

We set FOV to 90 degrees, since that's what the datasheet claims. The scaleFactor parameter is set so that pointing directly at the Sun returns a value of 1. The minOutput and maxOutput are just to provide bounds for the CSS output visualization we're going to use in vizard. The kellyFactor is set to 0.1, because this gives us roughly the response curve shown in the datasheet (see below). Bias is set to zero, and for good measure we introduce 1% sensor noise. In the second half we place one identical Sun sensor on each face of the spacecraft.

## Conclusion

In this post we discussed a sensor that is used in almost every attitude determination system: the coarse sun sensor. We used a real CSS datasheet as an example, analyzing characteristics like FOV, input power, and peak power, and came up with a good sensor model that accounts for sensor imperfections. Finally, we added some CSS units to our basilisk simulation and watched them report their outputs in real-time. In subsequent posts we'll look at some other sensors and will look at how to fuse them into an integrated attitude determination system.

Scrappy solutions like this can be appealing when designing something like a cubesat, where the size, weight, power, and cost budgets are all slim.
