# Overview

In my [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/08/09/mag.html), in which we covered the magnetometer, I promised that this post would add practical attitude determination to our simulation. Since then I've adjusted my plan, so that this is now a half truth. Jumping straight to full-on recursive (dynamic) attitude determination in one post turned out to be too big of a step. Also, I discovered that the necessary algorithm isn't yet part of Basilisk, which means I'll need to implement it myself, which will take some time (I do have a day job, after all).

So, instead of doing attitude determination, which generally involves estimation of attitude as well as rotational rates, we are going to cover sunline estimation, which just involves estimating the direction of the Sun and how that direction is changing.

# Sunline Estimation

The sunline is a line (represented by a vector) pointing from our spacecraft to the Sun. Sunline estimation involves estimating the parameters of this unit 3-vector and, typically, their respective rates of change. In other words, the state vector looks like this:

```python
state_vector = [
	sv_x, sv_y, sv_z,          # Sun vector
	sv_x_dt, sv_y_dt, sv_z_dt  # Rates of change
]
```

Now, remember that a single observation vector (e.g. the Sun vector) is insufficient to give us an attitude estimate. Specifically, if all we know is the Sun vector, we can rotate (roll) about the axis given by that vector and the vector will not change, so any such rotation is an equally valid attitude that gives that Sun vector.

## Why?

So, if knowing the sunline is not enough to give us our attitude estimate, why do we care? Well, because a good sunline estimate allows us to point at the Sun. By far the most common example is to point a spacecraft's solar cells at the Sun, so as to recharge batteries and ensure a steady supply of power. This needs to happen from time to time during nominal operations, but is also a common response to fault conditions: when a fault is detected one of the most critical aspects of a good response is to ensure that the spacecraft has access to power, because without power the spacecraft can't change its attitude, which means it can't get power, which means... mission over.

Another possible reason for sun pointing is the performance of science experiments. The [James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)](https://webb.nasa.gov/) needs to point *away* from the Sun so that it's giant sun shield can prevent solar radiation from affecting its measurements. More dramatically, there's the [Parker Solar Probe](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/), which in 2025 is scheduled to fly within 4.3 million miles of the Sun at a blistering 430,000 mph (heliocentric) - otherwise known as 0.064% the speed of light. Pretty cool. In order to survive in this extreme environment, the spacecraft is provided with a 11cm-thick solar shield, which, we may assume, needs to point at the Sun to be effective.

## How?

So, we've seen that sunline estimation is useful even if it doesn't provide a full attitude solution. The next question is: how can we achieve it? Well, in LEO, the easiest and cheapest way to do it is with Coarse Sun Sensors (CSSs), which we have [already discussed]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/07/26/css.html). Measurements from these sensors can be used as inputs to an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which provides a continuous estimate of the Sun vector parameters and their rates of change.

# Basilisk

Fortunately for my schedule, such an EKF already exists in Basilisk.

## The SunlineEKF interface

Here's a link to the [documentation](https://hanspeterschaub.info/basilisk/Documentation/fswAlgorithms/attDetermination/sunlineEKF/sunlineEKF.html). The basic idea is CSS measurements go in, and sun vector, sun vector rate of change, and associated covariance estimates come out. That doesn't tell you much, though. Let's take a closer look at how this module works.

First off, if you haven't read my posts on the [Kalman Filter]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/05/31/kf.html) and the [EKF]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/06/07/ekf.html), I suggest starting with those, as there's a fair number of terms and concepts from those posts that I'm going to invoke here. Having read those, you should be familiar with how these filters work in principle: a running estimate of a state vector and its covariance is updated at each time step by (1) incorporating dynamics via a process model and (2) incorporating observations via a measurement model. The difference with the EKF is that one or both of these models are assumed to be nonlinear, and must be linearized at each step before use.

### The state vector

The SunlineEKF uses a state vector that includes the parameters of the estimated Sun vector as well as its rates of change, meaning we have 6 state variables and a 6x6 covariance matrix. In other words: the state vector maps 1:1 to what we need to estimate. It's worth noting that this is not always the case. Many Kalman Filter designs keep extra state variables in the state vector - variables that aren't needed as outputs, but are needed as inputs to the process model. However, that's not the case here.

### The process model

The general idea of the process model is simple: the rate estimates are used to propagate the sun vector estimate forward in time, yielding an updated sun vector estimate. The rates are assumed to be constant (within the process model). There is, however, a complication: out state vector doesn't capture the full dynamics of the system. Remember that one observation vector (in this case the Sun vector) is insufficient to represent attitude. Well, we only have one such vector, so the roll about that vector is unknown to us. This is important because it's part of the dynamics. If we don't account for this in our process model, then our filter will make (likely erroneous) assumptions about it, which will pollute the state vector and estimates.

To account for this, the SunlineEKF projects states along the axis given by the Sun vector estimate and subtracts them, yielding a dynamics model

$$
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X}) = \begin{bmatrix}
		\mathbf{\dot{d}} - ((\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{\dot{d}}) \frac{\mathbf{d}}{||\mathbf{d}||^{2}}) \\
		-\frac{1}{\delta t} ((\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{\dot{d}}) \frac{\mathbf{d}}{||\mathbf{d}||^{2}})
	\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{\dot{d}}$ represent the Sun vector parameters and the rates, respectively. Doing so makes it explicit that the state vector input to the process model does not contain any information regarding roll about the Sun vector axis.

### The measurement model

The CSS is a very simple sensor, and the measurement model is correspondingly straightforward: for each sensor whose measurement exceeds a threshold, that sensor's normal is dotted with the Sun vector estimate and then the measurement is subtracted, yielding the innovation (the discrepancy between what is expected and what is measured). That innovation is then used later on in the calculation of the state error.

As with the process model, there's a slight complication. If the state covariance is high, then the linearization process may be inaccurate, which can lead to poor estimation and even filter instability. In order to prevent divergence, the SunlineEKF will temporarily switch to a linear measurement update step if the covariance exceeds a user-definable threshold. While this does nothing to improve the filter's estimates, it aids convergence and, once convergence is achieved, the full process with linearization can be resumed.

## Code

First we construct the model and provide initial estimates. These must be sensible, but the specific values don't matter too much. I recommend playing with these and seeing what happens.

```python
sunlineEstimator = sunlineEKF.sunlineEKF()
sunlineEstimator.ModelTag = "SunlineEKF"
sunlineEstimator.state = [1.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0]
sunlineEstimator.x = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
sunlineEstimator.covar = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
                          0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
                          0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
                          0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0,
                          0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0,
                          0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1]
```

Next we define the process noise and measurement noise.

```python
CSS_NOISE_STD = 0.01
sunlineEstimator.qProcVal = CSS_NOISE_STD
sunlineEstimator.qObsVal = CSS_NOISE_STD ** 2
```

Then we define two thresholds: the minimum measurement value required for a sensor's measurement to be used, and the covariance value above which the model should switch to a linear measurement update.

```python
sunlineEstimator.sensorUseThresh = np.sqrt(sunlineEstimator.qObsVal) * 5
sunlineEstimator.eKFSwitch = 5.0
```

Finally, all that's left is some boilerplate. We add the model to our simulation task and connect it to the appropriate CSS messages.

```python
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, sunlineEstimator)
sunlineEstimator.cssDataInMsg.subscribeTo(cssGroup.constellationOutMsg)
sunlineEstimator.cssConfigInMsg.subscribeTo(cssConfigMsg)
```

## Results

Not too bad. Our filter converges quickly and handles insufficient measurements gracefully (loss of accuracy but no divergence).

# Conclusion

In this post we added a sunline estimation system to our simulation - a partial attitude estimator that constitutes a first step towards a full-on attitude determination system. We opened with a discussion of why *partial* attitude determination is useful and how it can be done. Next we went into some detail about Basilisk's SunlineEKF estimator, and finally we added this module to our simulation and analyzed its performance. Soon, possibly in the next post, we will implement a full attitude determination system.
