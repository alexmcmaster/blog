This week's post is the first in a series about a topic that I love: spacecraft guidance, navigation and control, or GNC. We're going to use the free astrodynamics simluation framework Basilisk, from the AVS Lab at UC Boulder, to explore a range of subjects within this field, all the while building a progressively more realistic simulation in Earth orbit. Which subjects are we going to look at, and in what order? I'm not sure yet. Part of the motivation for this series is to refresh and update my knowledge of the field, which I stopped working in a few years ago. I will put an index here later, but for now the plan is to cover whatever I think is important and/or interesting. Let's get started.

## Spacecraft GNC

First things first: what is GNC? Put most simply, it's the study of how we can know where our spacecraft is, how it's moving, and how we can control where it is and how it's moving. Our spacecraft can be a satellite in Earth orbit, a satellite in orbit about another celestial body (typically called an "orbiter"), or a probe hurtling through the solar system. More broadly, it can also be a rocket flying into space, or a lander returning from space, though these cases are different enough to really be their own fields. Basically, it's any controllable object that flies in space.

## Astrodynamics Simulation

Space is hard, as we engineers are fond of saying. Margins are thin, everything is [eye-wateringly expensive](https://oig.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ig-24-001.pdf), and with [precious few exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope#Servicing_missions_and_new_instruments) our creations are beyond physical reach once they're in space. This means that, before we launch, we must try as hard as we possibly can to know that our spacecraft will work as intended.

There are many ways that we approach this problem, some of the most important being keeping things as simple as possible ([the KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)), using components that have already flown successfully (known as "spaceflight heritage"), and testing on the ground as realistically as we can ([test as you fly, fly as you test](https://llis.nasa.gov/lesson/1196)). One aspect of this last approach is to test on the ground in an astrodynamics simulation using computers. Astrodynamics basically means "things moving in space". We can simulate planets and moons, gravity, magnetic fields, solar radiation pressure, drag, and a host of other things that a spacecraft can (will) experience in space, and we can test how our spacecraft's software performs.

## Introducing Basilisk

Basilisk is a software framework that we can use to build such simulations. There are others, so why use Basilisk? Well, for starters, it's free to use and modify under the permissive [ISC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license). This is quite the perk, as a license for the industry-standard alternative, Ansys STK, costs on the order of tens of thousands of dollars per year (yes, my eyes are watering). Still, there are other free frameworks. I like Basilisk because its written in Python wrapped around a C++ core, with simulations organized as Python scripts. This makes it really easy to play with for someone (like me) that enjoys these languages. Also, it's a product of the AVS Lab under Dr. Hanspeter Schaub. I'm a big fan of this group for their support and their educational content. I highly recommend that you [check them out](https://hanspeterschaub.info/AVSlab.html). Finally, it comes with an impressive number of example simulations that demonstrate various parts of the framework and, if you're like me, are much easier to read and understand than API docs.

## A Basic Simulation

We're going to start with a simple simulation and add complexity in subsequent posts. For starters, we'll just put a generic, non-rotating, sensorless, uncontrolled satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). I will discuss the important bits (most of it) below, but see [here](https://github.com/alexmcmaster/basilisk/blob/alexmcmaster/develop/sims/sim0-baseline.py) for the full script, which I've made part of my [Basilisk fork](https://github.com/alexmcmaster/basilisk).

### Basic set up

```python
scSim = SimulationBaseClass.SimBaseClass()
```

First we instantiate an object of type SimBaseClass. This allows us to create processes, tasks, and models, which are discussed below.

```python
simProcessName = "simProcess"
dynProcess = scSim.CreateNewProcess(simProcessName)
```

Next we create a process and add it to our simulation. A process is just a way of grouping tasks, which we will cover next. For now, our simulation will just have one process.

```python
TIME_STEP_S = 0.05
ACCEL_FACTOR = 1.0
START_TIME = datetime(year=2012, month=5, day=1, hour=0, minute=28, second=30)
NUM_ORBITS = 0.01
simTaskName = "simTask"
simulationTimeStep = macros.sec2nano(TIME_STEP_S)
dynProcess.addTask(scSim.CreateNewTask(simTaskName, simulationTimeStep))
```

Now we're getting somewhere. We create a task and give it an update rate of 50ms. The update rate is an important quantity: too low and our simulation will take forever, too high and we may encounter unstable dynamics. I would like to use this simulation to explore attitude control later on, which means that unstable dynamics are a potential problem (this will be explained in a later post). So, I'm using a tick rate of 50ms, which, as a side note, is a plausible value for an actual spacecraft. 

```python
scObject = spacecraft.Spacecraft()
scObject.ModelTag = "bskSat"
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, scObject)
```

And last, we create a spacecraft model and add it to our task. Later on we will give it mass and define an inertia tensor, but for now we settle for whatever the defaults are. So, in summary, we have a spacecraft model, which is a member of a task with an update rate of 50ms, which in turn is a member of a process, which finally is a member of our simulation.

### Gravity

Since we live in the universe, gravity is important, and we want to simulate it.

```python
grav_factory = simIncludeGravBody.gravBodyFactory()
grav_bodies = grav_factory.createBodies("earth", "moon", "sun")
```

Here we specify that we want the Earth, Moon, and Sun to be present in our simulation. Other gravitational bodies will be ignored for now as their effects are minuscule in LEO.

```python
grav_bodies["earth"].isCentralBody = True
grav_bodies["earth"].useSphericalHarmonicsGravityModel(bskPath + "/supportData/LocalGravData/GGM03S.txt", 10)
grav_factory.addBodiesTo(scObject)
```

As we're in Earth orbit, Earth will be by far the most influential gravitational body in our simulation - so we do two things. First, we set Earth to be the center of our simulation. Second, we tell our simulation to model the Earth using [up to 10th order spherical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth). This means that our model of the Earth's gravitational influence will be far more accurate than if we used a simple point mass.

```python
```python
spice_time = START_TIME.strftime("%Y %b %d %X TDB")
gravFactory.createSpiceInterface(bskPath + "/supportData/EphemerisData/",
    time=spice_time, epochInMsg=True)
gravFactory.spiceObject.zeroBase = "Earth"
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, gravFactory.spiceObject)
```

Next, we use [SPICE](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/spiceconcept.html) to model the dynamics of our gravitational bodies so that we know where they are, relative to each other, at any given time. We need to give it a start time, the location of the data that it needs to do its thing, and tell it where we want our origin to be (Earth). Personally, I know very little about how SPICE works internally. It's a bit arcane: probably Fortran with big, esoterically-formatted data files. Suffice it to say that it was written by some very smart folks and has been used in many a successful space mission.

### Initial conditions

```python
oe = orbitalMotion.ClassicElements()
oe.a = 7e6  # meters
oe.e = 0.0001
oe.i = 33.3 * macros.D2R
oe.Omega = 48.2 * macros.D2R
oe.omega = 347.8 * macros.D2R
oe.f = 85.3 * macros.D2R
```

We define our spacecraft's orbit and its position within that orbit by specifying the 6 [Keplerian orbial elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements#Keplerian_elements). The macro ```D2R``` converts from degrees to radians.

```python
mu_earth = grav_bodies["earth"].mu
rN, vN = orbitalMotion.elem2rv(mu, oe)
scObject.hub.r_CN_NInit = rN  # meters
scObject.hub.v_CN_NInit = vN  # meters per second
```

We use these orbital elements to determine the starting position and velocity vectors, and assign these to our spacecraft.

### Final set up

```python
numDataPoints = 400
samplingTime = unitTestSupport.samplingTime(simulationTime,
                                            simulationTimeStep,
                                            numDataPoints)
dataLog = scObject.scStateOutMsg.recorder(samplingTime)
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, dataLog)
```

In order to save information about the spacecraft state for analysis, we need to make sure it's recorded. We do this by creating a recorder model and, of course, adding it to our task.

```python
vizSupport.enableUnityVisualization(scSim, simTaskName, scObject,
                                    liveStream=True)
```

This line allows us to visualize the simulation at run time as well as after the fact. It uses Vizard, which you can get [here](https://hanspeterschaub.info/basilisk/Vizard/VizardDownload.html).

```python
clockSync = simSynch.ClockSynch()
clockSync.accelFactor = ACCEL_FACTOR  # real-time
scSim.AddModelToTask(simTaskName, clockSync)
scSim.InitializeSimulation()
n = np.sqrt(mu / oe.a / oe.a / oe.a)
P = 2. * np.pi / n  # Orbial period
simulationTime = macros.sec2nano(P * NUM_ORBITS)
scSim.ConfigureStopTime(simulationTime)
scSim.SetProgressBar(True)
```

We then configure the simulation to run in real-time. The accelFactor member can be increased to make the simulation run faster, or decreased to make it run more slowly. Then we initialize the simulation, tell it how long to run, and ask it to report its progress with a progress bar.

### Execution and plotting

```python
scSim.ExecuteSimulation()
```

Now, finally, this line begins the simulation. If you have connected to Vizard you will see something like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bsk/vizard.png" width="100%" />
*Vizard in action.*

Once the simulation has completed we can take a closer look at the results.

```python
plt.figure(1)
fig = plt.gcf()
ax = fig.gca()
ax.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False, style='plain')
for idx in range(3):
    plt.plot(dataLog.times() * macros.NANO2SEC / P, posData[:, idx] / 1000.,
             color=unitTestSupport.getLineColor(idx, 3),
             label='$r_{BN,' + str(idx) + '}$')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.xlabel('Time [orbits]')
plt.ylabel('Inertial Position [km]')
```

This generates a plot of the position vector coordinates throughout the simulation (turns out these don't change very much in 1/100 of an orbit).

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bsk/position-vector.png" width="100%" />
*A plot of the position vector coordinates.*

And that pretty much covers it.

## Conclusion

In this post we raised the issue of testing spacecraft on the ground and introduced the Basilisk astrodynamics simulation framework as a way to do this. We built our own simulation and walked through the code step-by-step. In subsequent posts we will modify this very basic simulation to add more complexity and realism.
